Hello, this is a new blog and my first one since puberty. What's most important about blogging is the possibility of keeping tracking of my own activities, so it will firstly serve myself. Other than that I'm excited about the technology I'm using. 

By the last week my team's head developer started talking about it and even made a remake of his own blog.
So, it's neither Wordpress nor Joomla, it doesn't even need a database to work. It's just markdown language fired with Jekyll, as said in it's own documentation, "Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator". It means that my blog is a bunch of .md files auto related by a engine named after the novel about a lawyer that becomes a monster. 

I'm just starting reading about all of it but I can promise you I'm going to write more and better about this engine that, ops, forgot to mention, uses the github and it's pages system. 

Other thing that you will probably notice is that I don't have a clue about how I should write and I didn't even decide which public I'm going to aim. So, let's first think of a guy that works as a developer, uses linux and writes it's code on PHP, mostly.

Hope I'll enjoy doing it and if you also do so, lucky us...
